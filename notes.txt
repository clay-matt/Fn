    1. Morphism Handling:
    Fix input line handling of morphisms.  Currently, a morphism is outputed in the form:
        { a:a b:Ab A:A B:Ba }
    But to load this morphism on the input line, the program expects:
        { a, Ab } or optionally { a, Ab : image_rank }
    This is annoying, the way morphisms are handled should be consistent.
    ** 05/25/2011 ** Fixed - morphisms are now outputed in the form { a, Ab : image_rank }

    2. Program Icon:
    Dock icon is tiny.
    ** 11/05/2010 ** Fixed

    3. Status Bar:
    By default, status bar is made, change to showStatus.
    ** 11/05/2010 ** Fixed

    4. Conjugacy Problem:
    Status Tip is invalid, programs returns error if user tries to supply rank
    ** 11/05/2010 ** Fixed

    Program crashed when trying to load the morphism F_3 -> F_2 given by a->a, b->b, c->1
    ** 02/11/11 ** Fixed

    1. Functionality to Add:
        Online help/documentation
        Help browser using QtWebKit
        Xml reading/writing (as opposed to or in addition to saving?)

    2. Features to Add:

        Whitehead Graphs
